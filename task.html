According to the Hindu calendar this religious festival is celebrated on <i>the Ashtami of Krishna Paksh or the 8th day of the dark fortnight in the month of Bhadon</i>.
Sri Krishna is considered as the one of the most powerful human incarnations of the Lord Vishnu. He was born around <b>5,200</b> years ago in Mathura.The sole objective of Sri Krishna's birth was to free the Earth from the evilness of demons. He played an important role in Mahabharata and propagated the theory of bhakti and good karma which are narrated deeply in the Bhagwat Geeta.
Sri Krishna was born in a prison in the custody of Kansa. Vasudev, His father immediately thought of his friend<i> Nand</i> and decided to hand over his child to him to save Krishna from the clutch of Kansa. Krishna grew up in Gokul and finally killed his uncle, King Kansa.The actual celebration of Janmashtami takes place during the midnight as Sri Krishna is believed to be borned on a dark, stormy and windy night to end the rule and violence of his uncle, Kansa.All over India this day is celebrated with devotional songs and dances, pujas, arti, blowing of the Conch and rocking the cradle of baby Sri Krishna.
The Janmashtami celebration of Mathura and Vrindavan, the places where Sri Krishna had spent his life, are very special.<br>On this day temples and homes are wonderfully decorated and illuminated. Night long prayers are offered and religious mantras are sung in the temples.<br>Janmashtami (popularly known as "Gokulashtami" as in Maharashtra) is celebrated in cities such as Mumbai, Nagpur and Pune. Dahi Handi is celebrated every August/September, the day after Krishna Janmashtami.The term literally means "earthen pot of yoghurt". The festival gets this popular regional name from legend of baby Krishna. According to it, he would seek and steal milk products such as yoghurt and butter and people would hide their supplies high up out of the baby's reach. Krishna would try all sorts of creative ideas in his pursuit, such as making human pyramids with his friends to break these high hanging pots.This story is the theme of numerous reliefs on Hindu temples across India, as well as literature and dance-drama repertoire, symbolizing the joyful innocence of children, that love and life's play is the manifestation of god.<br>Also called Krishnashtami, SaatamAatham,Gokulashtami, Yadukulashtami, Srikrishna Jayanti,Sree Jayanti.The festival of Janmashtami is celebrated with great fun and gaiety all over the world by the Hindus owing to the fact that Sri Krishna was one of the most forceful human incarnations of Lord Vishnu. Krishna is one such God in Hindu mythology, about whose birth and death, a lot has been written.The festival of Janmashtami is celebrated with great fun and gaiety all over the world by the Hindus owing to the fact that Sri Krishna was one of the most forceful human incarnations of Lord Vishnu.
